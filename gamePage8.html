        Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the
        existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is
        sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and
        space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct
        classic 2D perspectives.
      </p>
      <p id="text2">
        After the game appears to glitch, reset and reboot, the player can
        rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a
        cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the
        levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and is the basis
        of Fez's puzzles.
