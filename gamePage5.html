        Eddy Violet is an Dreampunk and Postcyberpunk-based ACT game developed
        in the span of two years. I finished all the sections of game design by
        myself including 30 pieces of original music

        The Great Mother eliminated the old world, re-established new order upon
        the science civilization's ruins. She has been creating numerous
        energy-state lives and led the world to the completely new ecosystem.
        But the Great Mother can't destroy her own creations, which means that
        if those creatures rise in rebellion, god would feel helpless and the
        new world would return to chaos.
