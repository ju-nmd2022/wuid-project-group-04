        Adore is an action creature collecting game where the main character,
        Lukha, is able to summon and control creatures to fight by his side in a
        simple and innovative way.
      </p>
      <p id="text2">
        In Adore, you can customize your game style according to the creatures
        you capture. Each of them has very different characteristics and
        abilities. On top of that, there are the Synergy System, Traits and
        Special Abilities, which allows for even more varied playstyles and
        powerful combos.
